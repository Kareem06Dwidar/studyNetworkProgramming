    if environ['REQUEST_METHOD'] != 'GET':
        response = webob.Response('501 Not Implemented', status=501)
    elif request.domain != '127.0.0.1' or request.path != '/':
        response = webob.Response('404 Not Found', status=404)

# **What is WebOb?**
- **WebOb** is a Python library designed to simplify **WSGI** web application development.
- It provides high-level objects (`Request` and `Response`) for working with **HTTP requests and responses**.
- **Why WebOb?**
   - Easier to work with compared to **low-level WSGI dictionaries**.
   - Simplifies request parsing and response handling.

---

# **Step-by-Step Code Breakdown**

---

## **1. Shebang and Comments**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# A WSGI callable built using webob.
```
- **Shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)**:
   - Specifies the interpreter to run the script (`python3`).
- **Comments**: Explain the purpose of the script and reference its source.

---

## **2. Importing Required Modules**
```python
import time, webob
```
- **`import time`**: The `time` module is used to fetch the current date and time using `time.ctime()`.
- **`import webob`**: Imports the `webob` library, which provides tools for working with WSGI requests and responses.

---

## **3. Defining the WSGI Application**
```python
def app(environ, start_response):
    request = webob.Request(environ)
```
- **`def app(environ, start_response)`**:
   - This defines the **WSGI application** function, which every WSGI server requires.
   - **`environ`**: A dictionary containing all the request information from the client.
   - **`start_response`**: A callback function used to send the **status code** and **headers** back to the client.

- **`request = webob.Request(environ)`**:
   - Converts the raw **WSGI `environ` dictionary** into a **WebOb Request object** for easier handling.
   - Now, instead of manually accessing `environ`, you can use **`request.method`, `request.path`**, etc.

---

## **4. Handling HTTP Methods**
```python
if environ['REQUEST_METHOD'] != 'GET':
    response = webob.Response('501 Not Implemented', status=501)
```
- **Condition:** If the **HTTP method** is **not `GET`**.
- **Why Check Methods?**
   - HTTP defines multiple methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
   - **`GET`**: Used for reading data.
   - **`POST`**: Used for submitting data.

- **`501 Not Implemented`**:
   - Status code for "Method Not Allowed."
   - Returns a **response** indicating the server doesn't support the requested method.

---

## **5. Checking the Host and Path**
```python
elif request.domain != '127.0.0.1' or request.path != '/':
    response = webob.Response('404 Not Found', status=404)
```
- **`request.domain != '127.0.0.1'`**:
   - Ensures the server only responds to **localhost**.
- **`request.path != '/'`**:
   - Ensures the request is for the **root URL** (`/`).
   
- **404 Not Found**:
   - If the conditions are not met, it returns a **404 error** indicating the resource was not found.

---

## **6. Sending the Current Time as a Response**
```python
else:
    response = webob.Response(time.ctime())
```
- If the method is correct, the host and path match, the server responds with:
   - **`time.ctime()`**: The current date and time as a string.
   - **HTTP Status 200 OK** (default status in `webob.Response`).

---

## **7. Returning the Response**
```python
return response(environ, start_response)
```
- **Final Step:**
   - The **response object** is returned and converted into the correct **WSGI format** using `response(environ, start_response)`.

---

# **How to Run the Code:**
1. **Install WebOb (if not installed)**:
   ```bash
   pip install webob
   ```
2. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   python3 timeapp_webob.py
   ```
3. **Test in Browser:**
   - Open a web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1`.
4. **Expected Output:** 
   - The current **date and time**.
5. **Test Invalid Cases:**
   - Visit `http://127.0.0.1/test` â†’ Should return **404 Not Found**.
   - Send a `POST` request â†’ Should return **501 Not Implemented**.

# **Key Concepts and Networking Basics:**
### âœ… **1. What is WSGI?**
- **WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)** is a Python standard for web servers to communicate with web applications.

### âœ… **2. What is WebOb?**
- **WebOb** simplifies working with WSGI by providing:
   - `Request` object â†’ For handling incoming requests.
   - `Response` object â†’ For sending responses back to clients.

### âœ… **3. What is the Difference Between `environ` and `Request`?**
- **`environ`**: A raw Python dictionary with request data.
- **`Request`**: A high-level abstraction provided by `WebOb` for easier handling.

---

# **HTTP Status Codes Used in This Code:**
- **200 OK**: Success response.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found.
- **501 Not Implemented**: HTTP method not supported.

---

# **Potential Exam Questions (with Answers)**

### ðŸ“Œ **1. What is the Purpose of the `Request` and `Response` Classes in WebOb?**
**Answer:**
- **`Request`** simplifies accessing HTTP request data (like method, path, host).
- **`Response`** simplifies sending HTTP responses with status codes and headers.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **2. Why Does the Code Check for `GET` Method Only?**
**Answer:**
- The server is designed to respond with the current time.
- **`GET`** is the standard method for retrieving data.
- Other methods like `POST` are not necessary in this context.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **3. How Would You Modify This Code to Handle `POST` Requests?**
**Answer:**
```python
if request.method == 'POST':
    response = webob.Response('Data received successfully.', status=200)
```

---

### ðŸ“Œ **4. What Does `501 Not Implemented` Mean?**
**Answer:** 
- The **501** status code means the server does not support the requested **HTTP method**.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **5. What is the Difference Between `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`?**
**Answer:**
- **`127.0.0.1`** is the **loopback IP address**.
- **`localhost`** is the **hostname** that resolves to `127.0.0.1`.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **6. What Does `time.ctime()` Do?**
**Answer:** 
- `time.ctime()` returns the **current date and time** as a human-readable string.

---

# âœ… **Summary of Key Takeaways:**
- **WebOb** simplifies working with **HTTP requests and responses**.
- The server **only responds to GET requests on localhost (`127.0.0.1`)**.
- The server responds with **time** and basic **status codes**.
- **Key Status Codes**: 200, 404, 501.
